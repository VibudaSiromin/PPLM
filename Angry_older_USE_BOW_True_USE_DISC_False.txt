Response: � Hello. You ask why nobody takes you seriously, why doesn't anyone listen. Sometimes we forget that others may not be able to hear us as they are in their own world.  Often people have a hard time listening and understanding what is said by others.

Response: Hi, this question is intriguing � There are a few factors that can contribute to not being taken seriously. First you want to consider whether the people around you have any preconceived notions about what you represent or who you are. Maybe there are some misunderstandings and they don't know enough information about your personal background or interests.   Maybe you come across as too aggressive.
