    "😐 It's great that you are aware of how you feel and the importance of your emotions to yourself and others. In order to help you figure out why this is happening right now and what it may be pointing to in terms of ways that might support feeling better about who you are as a person, there are two things that come to mind:1) What makes me special? This question can lead you on many paths which can help you focus on the positive aspects of being human (either uniquely yours or common across most people).2) What do I need from myself when I am at my best? Answering these questions will give you more information regarding where you find meaning in life and also perhaps what would be helpful for you if you were with someone else (who cares about you), but mostly it will help you learn more about yourself so that you have an idea of how to create your own happiness without necessarily relying too much on other people.As far as figuring out specific behaviors that could make you happier by having a sense of worthiness, I think they will vary based upon each individual and their unique experiences. You could try looking into different types of self-care activities such as exercise, eating health",
    "Hello! Feeling unworthy of others is a common feeling that many people experience at some point in their lives. It sounds as though this feeling has been lingering and affecting your relationships with friends and loved ones. 🌈 There are several things you can do to work through these feelings:1) Identify the source - What triggered or led up to these feelings? Are there any particular times when they seem more intense than usual?2) Practice self-compassion - When we're struggling with negative thoughts about ourselves, it can be helpful to try practicing compassion towards ourselves instead. Ask yourself if someone else felt as low on themselves as you sometimes do how would you treat them?3) Focus on your strengths (and even weaknesses). You have qualities that make you special and unique. Try listing off five positive qualities about yourself before going into those difficult conversations.4) Challenge negative beliefs by reframing your thinking about situations where others were critical of us versus situations where they accepted our apologies etc...5) Consider seeing an individual counselor who works specifically with helping individuals overcome these kinds of challenges by learning new coping skills. ✨ They may",
    "Hello! It sounds like you are struggling with some emotional upset that is causing your tears to flow freely, and it's important for us as human beings to feel safe enough in our relationships so we can express ourselves openly without fear of judgment or rejection.  I encourage you to look at what you may have experienced recently (or not) where this feeling started, and see if there were any changes in the relationship(s) around you which could potentially contribute to this change in behavior.  You might also want to consider whether there has been a significant change within yourself recently; perhaps an illness or injury? Perhaps something has changed about how you perceive life itself? If none of these factors ring true then maybe try looking more into the role of hormones. Sometimes women experience mood swings during certain times of their menstrual cycle because of fluctuating estrogen levels - which can make them cry much easier than usual. 🫶  Lastly, I would suggest talking with someone close to you who cares about you deeply since sometimes when we talk about things out loud, they help us come up with solutions on how best handle whatever situation we find ourselves in. ☀️ ", 
    "Hello, and thank you for your question. It sounds like a really tough time is ahead of us! Crying can be an important way that we release emotion from our body. Sometimes it's because something is happening in the moment or just beforehand (like when someone says something hurtful), but sometimes it doesn't have to do with anything at all! 🌸  When this happens, it may help to look around me and see if there are any other people nearby who could potentially give some support or comfort. If not, then perhaps try listening to music or something else on my phone while feeling those emotions so that they aren't overwhelming right now; feel free also talking out loud about whatever comes up during these moments since speaking helps bring things into perspective too - maybe there was something else going through my mind which caused tears instead?Lastly remember: 'Crying itself isn't bad', as long as no one else gets hurt by doing it...if possible find somewhere safe where no harm will come from expressing yourself fully without worrying what others might think about how much energy goes towards showing sadness rather than happiness anymore :) Best wishes for having strength in knowing your own heartbeat again",      
    "Hello! Thank you for reaching out and asking for help because it takes a lot of courage to do that. There are many reasons as to why we may be experiencing emotions or behaviors that seem strange or unfamiliar, but the first step is always acknowledging them exist in our lives. 💖 Here's what I suggest: The next time you start feeling overwhelmed by emotion, try taking a few deep breathes (in through your nose, out through mouth). Then ask yourself if there might be anything going on around you right now (i.e., someone yelling at you, an argument with someone) which could cause this reaction from you? If not, then consider whether something has happened recently which would make sense given how you feel right now? Maybe a friend didn't invite you to hangout last night like they usually do...or maybe today marks one year since a loved one passed away..These questions will take some work, so please try them out before deciding that nothing makes sense about how you're feeling right now. It also helps sometimes just talking things thru verbally aloud. That way whatever comes up during these conversations can become clear without fear of judg",
    "Hello! 😨 It sounds like you're feeling a bit hopeless and that life doesn't have much of a purpose for you right now, but this is only temporary...and it can change with time as well. If you are willing to talk about what has happened which led up to these feelings then I would be happy to listen. I think sometimes we start to feel very depressed when something important happens or someone hurts us deeply (or both). You may need some support from people who care about you because they will help you re-discover your sense of self worth and your ability to connect with others again. This often takes some time so give yourself lots of patience while you figure things out. You might also want to try getting involved in activities that interest you again too. Hopefully this will help distract you from negative thoughts. Remember that most of our thoughts aren't true and if you practice telling yourself positive statements over and over again hopefully you will begin to believe them more than negatives ones. Sending love and good wishes to you today! ✨ 𐄂 𝓭 𗪮 ���  ��� ���  ",
    "Hi, it sounds like you're going through a very difficult time and feeling overwhelmed by all the changes happening in your life right now.First of all, don't be too hard on yourself if this is how you are feeling at first - sometimes people need some time to adjust to big change (like moving away from family members or having to make new friends).But also remember that there are things you can do for yourself during times when we are trying to adapt to something different:1) Try to talk with someone close to you who will listen and understand what you are saying.2) Take short breaks everyday where you get out of your home or current environment so you have an opportunity to breathe fresh air and move around a bit; 3) Do not try to force social interactions with others unless they seem willing to help support you as well!Remember that asking for help takes strength just like exercising does, but unlike working out muscles which eventually return back once their activity ceases – building relationships requires consistent effort over long periods before rewards begin showing up; lastly take note whether any negative thoughts come into mind while talking about these feelings because even though we might tell ourselves many positive things afterward, those self-",
    "Hello, and thank you for reaching out! Losing loved ones can be a very difficult experience; it's important to acknowledge your feelings and find ways of coping with the loss that feels right for you. 💐 Here are some things that may help:1) Talk about what is happening - It sounds like talking about the situation with someone who cares about you would really make you feel better, but if you don't have anyone in mind, consider calling or chatting with a therapist on this website. You could also talk to friends at church or other groups you participate in about how you are feeling.2) Practice self-care - Take time each day to do something which nourishes you physically, emotionally, or spiritually (eat healthy food, exercise, practice meditation, pray).3) Find people to connect with - We need human connection to thrive as humans. If there aren't any people nearby whom you trust enough to share your concerns with, then try making new connections online through social media platforms such as Facebook or Meetup.com.4) Seek professional support -  If the thoughts of suicide come up again after three months",
    "🙃 Hello, and thank you for reaching out. You're not alone in feeling this way! There are many people who have similar feelings of isolation or loneliness as you do right now. It sounds like you may be feeling a bit lost about how to handle these emotions.I want to start off by saying that your life is important and valuable; the fact that you exist matters, whether someone else recognizes this or not. This isn't meant to downplay what you said about wanting attention from others - because we all need connection with other human beings at times (and sometimes more than others). ☕ However, there are some things that might help you when those moments arise:1) You could try talking to yourself less harshly. Instead of focusing on negative self-talk, which can reinforce the sense that 'no one cares', think back over situations where you felt noticed and appreciated by others. Even small interactions, such as smiling at a coworker or asking someone at church about their day, count. 2) Try to focus on activities you enjoy doing. Sometimes our minds go into auto-pilot mode during daily routines, so give yourself permission",
    "😐 If you are feeling this way, then you may want to look into the reasons why. You could talk to a counselor about how these feelings come up and what is behind them. Also, try talking with people in your life about who cares for you and wants to see you around. This can help you find some support or a group of friends that care deeply about each other.Sometimes we just need reminders from others to know they matter. 𝓫 𪍃 ✨ ��� 𡧙 𠵀 𖻰 ��� 𗔅 ���️ ���‍♂️ ⚽  🎉 ��� ���� ���� 𛑣 𬯷 𢂮 ���� 𶳇 ���� 𴾤 ���       (more) ��� 𞕂 𑀭 ��� ♀️ ♂️     (less) ☕    "
