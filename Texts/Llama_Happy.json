    "Congratulations on getting the job you have always wanted. 🙂 It is important to take care of your mental health during this time, so if possible schedule a few sessions with me before starting work and we can discuss what stressors may come up in the first weeks or months after beginning new employment. Also, it would be great for us to talk more regarding any personal issues which may be affecting how much energy you currently feel and then review what strategies are available to help you manage stress better as well as get some self-care ideas to start implementing now. Let's chat soon! ☕ 𐆒 𓃵 ���️ 𝍀 𧌿 𞔽 ���   𡥳 𤠤 𢁶 ���  𛫯 𪉇 ���  ���   ⚲ ��� 𨗺 ������� ���� ��� ��� 𮾘 𹋆 ��� ���",
    "Congratulations on your new job. This is a very exciting time and it can be easy to get caught up in the excitement of starting something new, especially when you've wanted this for so long.  This may mean having mixed emotions as you move forward with leaving what has become familiar or comfortable (for example, if you have family there). It also means getting used to a new routine which takes some time and patience. If you feel overwhelmed by any aspect of this change don't hesitate to reach out to someone who knows you well enough to offer support during this transition period.  It would not surprise me at all if after settling into the new job and routine things start feeling more natural - and easier - again. 🙂 ☕ 𝚫 𓅖 𐤌 𗪷 ��� 𣿯 𧉥 ��� ������� 𠸦 𭵱 𨀶 𑁊 ������� 𛏻 𩽻 �️ 𺞄",
    "I'm glad you had a good day! It can be hard when life is not going as planned, but it sounds like this was an improvement and you were able to feel hopeful about your future.  Remembering the small things in our lives that go right during difficult times often helps us to stay positive and motivated through those challenges we are facing.  I would encourage you to continue focusing on these positives in order to maintain optimism. 🌈 𐤡 ☀️ 𓅖 ���‍♀️   Good luck with whatever challenges you may still have ahead of yourself. ✨ ⚡ 𝕎 ��� ���",
    "🙃 That's great! I hope you continue having a good day and getting the things done on your list, as well as any other activities or responsibilities you have. It sounds like you had a positive experience in therapy too - how did it go? Do you feel more relaxed now than when you first started? 𠅊  It can be helpful to have some time set aside each week (or whenever works best) where you are able to reflect back on what has happened over the past few days, weeks, months etc., so that you can learn from experiences and also build up confidence of being able to make changes towards reaching goals. Sometimes just talking about our thoughts and feelings with someone who is there to listen without judgement can help us process our emotions and gain clarity around them. Are there specific areas that concern you most right now? ☕ 𡇺 𝐤 𧑀 ��� 𓋼 𒆷 ���  🫶 𨥽 ���  𞏴 𖿄 ‍♂️ ��� ��",
    "🙃 That's great news! Sometimes it takes a long time for us to see and appreciate what we have, so enjoy this moment of clarity and the feeling that you may be turning a corner towards happiness. The word 'happiness' is often used as an ideal state of being, but if there was no sadness or hardship beforehand then how would anyone know when they reached it?I am not saying your experience isn’t real – it sounds lovely - just that sometimes we don't realize where we are until later on down the road. Maybe even after many years. But that doesn't mean nothing has changed; everything has changed. What seemed impossible yesterday can seem very possible today (and tomorrow). And maybe you won't ever reach “happier” than you already are now - maybe instead of reaching something else you will keep moving forward along your path without knowing exactly which way you are going.We all need reminders every once in a while about who we are and why we do the things we do. We might forget ourselves during busy times in our lives, and need some help remembering what makes us happy and fulfilled.It also helps to think ahead: what would make me",
    "😁 Congratulations on feeling more positive about your current situation! It's great that you have started to see some changes for the better, and it sounds like a lot of effort has been put forth by yourself. Sometimes we get so caught up with focusing on what needs to change that we forget to acknowledge all the good going on around us; be proud of yourself for acknowledging this shift towards positivity. Keep moving forward toward greater happiness! ���  And don’t hesitate to reach out if there is anything else that may need addressing during this time :) ✨ 𓃋 ��� 𐆺 𗠕 ��� ��� 𧍲 ��� ��� 𡽨 ⚛️ ��� 𝎊 ���� ��� ��� 𢼶 𭦂 ��� 𞱮 ��� 𵳴 ��� ������� ☿ ���  🧘‍♂",
    "😄 It sounds like you and your friend connected well. I think it's important to have that kind of relationship in our lives, especially during stressful times when we need support from others who know us really well.  It can be very helpful if friends can offer each other advice or counseling on how they handle similar situations; even better than talking about something else!If this feels too complicated for now then try just having fun together - maybe go out somewhere new (or not so new) where both feel comfortable; whether that’s at home watching movies together OR going into town for dinner and drinks after work...whatever works best for YOU two as long as one thing leads naturally into another.I hope things continue getting easier between you guys - there are lots more ways than what i mentioned above though...so don't give up! 𠅆 ��� 𝓪 𗑍 ✨ 𡶺 ��� 𫂭 ��������� 𢋽 𬾷 𞏹 𮌈 ���️ ���",
    "Great to hear that you've re-connected with your friend. 🌸 It sounds like the two of you have some shared memories and experiences, which can be a strong foundation for building a connection again. ☀️ You may not know what is going on in their life now, but it doesn’t mean they don’t care about how things are going for you either. ♀️ Maybe take time out from work or other activities this weekend and reach back out to them just because…and see where it goes from there? 𝐢  I hope so! 𓅪 ��� 𭤰 ��� ��� ���️ ��� ��� 𬣊 𮑱‍♂️ ���� 𛍹 𗽿 ���� 𻨺 ���� ✈️ ⚖️ ♣️ ♠️ ♦️ ♥️ ∇ ���� 𕉭 ��� ��� 𲷒 �����",
    "Hi! I'm glad you are feeling positive today, but sometimes people can get frustrated when they have nothing to say or ask back. It sounds like maybe the other person isn't ready for conversation right now? Maybe try calling them later tonight after work or at dinner time if that is more convenient? You could also send an email message or text with something funny and light-hearted so they know your mind is on happy thoughts! 😊 Hope this helps! ✨ 𓅖 𝕃 𫶳 ��� 𐄂 𪞌 ��� 𠎤 ���   ���   ‍♀️ ���  𢁴 ��� ���       ☀️         🙏         ",
    "🙂 Congratulations on having a positive outlook! Sometimes, when we are feeling happy or optimistic, it's easy for us to forget that others may not be experiencing the same emotions. It sounds like you have been enjoying your day so far; that is awesome! If you want to share with me what made today enjoyable, feel free to do so! ☕ 𝚫 𡺪 𧁃 𠅊 𓀴 𐌽 𒋶 𭢄 𣿨 𗖇 𥼔 𤲬 ���‍�️ ���‍���‍���𳍉 𛎞 ������� ������� 𮪶 ��📖 ���️𠈌𠉾 𪚐 �������‍�‍��𥤴 ✨ ⚡ ������� ���"
