    "Hi there. You are right to be upset when you feel that your voice is not being heard and taken seriously. This can also be a very frustrating feeling, especially if it happens often in different situations. üí° It's possible that some people may have difficulty taking you seriously because they don't see or hear the same level of conviction as others do when you speak. There could be other reasons for this too - maybe people just aren't used to seeing you assert yourself so strongly (or perhaps you tend to hold back from expressing yourself more than usual). Whatever the reason, try practicing speaking with greater confidence by focusing on using firm but respectful language while still showing empathy towards those who might disagree with what you say. If nothing else works then consider seeking professional help such as counseling which will give you tools needed to communicate effectively and make sure everyone takes notice! ‚òï ´Öß ìÉ∂ ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ ùêö †Åø ™Çô ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ ñ•∫ £®© ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ",
    "Hi there,I can understand the frustration and sense of not being heard. It sounds like you feel as if your voice is falling on deaf ears, which must be very painful for you. However, it's important to remember that just because someone doesn't seem to care or hear what we have to say at first glance, this might mean they are simply unaware of our message or don't know how to respond appropriately right now.It could also be possible that some people may only react when something feels urgent (like a threat), while others require more time to process information before taking action. If we expect immediate results from those around us without giving them enough space for reflection, then perhaps we should reconsider whether having an expectation was really fair in the first place!One way to handle situations where you feel ignored would involve asking yourself questions such as 'What am I hoping will happen once my point has been made?' or even better yet ask directly by saying something along these lines: 'Hey friend - do u listen sometimes instead of talking over top so much; maybe give one another a chance 2 fully express ourselves? I get feeling undervalued here.'This approach gives both parties involved a clear idea about what needs changing",
    "üò¢ It sounds like you are feeling very hurt and frustrated by the way some of your relationships have gone in the past. I am sorry that this has happened to you, but it is good news for us because we can learn from these experiences.  The fact that many other women seem to be able to form successful long-term romantic partnerships suggests that there may not be anything wrong with men or even ourselves as potential partners.  It could just mean that we need to figure out what makes a healthy relationship work for each person involved. Learning about our own needs and expectations within any type of relationship will help prevent disappointment going forward. If we know ahead of time exactly how much affection, communication, emotional support, etc., we require in order to feel satisfied and happy then we won't blame others when things don't go as planned (either on their part or mine). We also should try our best at every moment during an argument before reacting emotionally. This gives both parties time to think about what was said and consider more logical ways of resolving conflict rather than simply attacking back without thinking first about the consequences. In general, my advice would be for",
    "It sounds like you've had some really painful experiences in your past and that these have led to a general distrust of others. This is understandable - it can be very difficult to feel vulnerable or open with other people when we don't know whether the relationship will end badly. While this fear may protect us from feeling hurt again (at least for a little while), there are definitely better ways to deal with our emotions than cutting ourselves off from human connection entirely. I wonder if you could try practicing some small acts of trusting yourself first? For example, maybe you wouldn't normally go out alone on Friday nights because 'what if something happens?' But one weekend, what would happen if you went out by yourself anyway just once? Or maybe you never eat food at work unless you ask permission, but this week you decide not to ask. If neither of those things happened then you were wrong about what might occur and you got through it without trouble. Do any of those situations come up where it was okay for you to take care of yourself as opposed to asking permission from everyone else? If so, keep doing them until you get more comfortable making decisions without consulting anyone else. Then perhaps start adding smaller steps towards trust",
    "I'm sorry you are experiencing anger. Anger is a natural emotion, but when it becomes overwhelming or frequent, it may be helpful to see someone about what is going on in your life and how it makes you feel. If possible, take some time away from the situation that triggered the anger to give yourself space for reflection. Reflecting with an open mind will help you find out why you became angry at whatever happened. In addition to seeking professional help (such as talking therapy), there are ways of calming down after an event occurs which could have made you angry. One way is physical exercise such as running or lifting weights. The release of tension through physical movement often helps reduce feelings of stress and anxiety. Another option is relaxation exercises like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and visualization. If these strategies don't work, try journaling or writing poetry. Sometimes putting words onto paper can bring clarity to our thoughts and emotions, allowing us to gain perspective on difficult situations.Remember that no one deserves treatment based upon their emotional state; however if you notice changes in behavior towards others, including suicidal ideations, please seek emergency",
    "I'd be happy to help you with your question. It sounds like it is really hard for you when anger arises, and that might make things worse (like if you feel out of control). This doesn't mean that there isn't something wrong in the situation - just because you are able to get yourself angry doesn's mean someone else didn't do or say something harmful toward you.   The way we respond to events is based on our own thoughts about them, which means how much a person feels they have 'control' over their emotions will determine whether or not those feelings occur at all.  Therefore, since everyone has some level of ability to manage their emotional responses, no one should ever become too upset unless they want to be. The key word here would then seem to be 'want.' How many times could you honestly answer yes to questions such as these:Do you generally react emotionally without thinking first?Are you more likely to fight back than walk away from an argument?Does someone usually try to make decisions before talking through options together?If you answered yes to any of these questions, you probably don't know what causes people to act this way towards others. If you",
    "Hi there. You're probably already aware that the way you feel about yourself is not a good place for anyone else to be in (including the people who are talking down to you). The only thing we can do when someone treats us badly is try to improve our own self-esteem so that they don't get under your skin and keep on coming back. It sounds like these people have no idea how much you care about what other people think of them; otherwise they would never speak or act this way toward others. For example, even though you may be able to ignore their insults right now, you will continue feeling bad until you work out why it hurts so much. If you have feelings left over from childhood days then that may help explain things too. In order to develop your sense of self, you must first accept what happened during those times. This doesn't mean blaming any particular family member because most often everyone was doing the best they could at the time with whatever tools were available to them. Then go ahead and forgive them - remembering all along that you didn't deserve anything but love growing up as a child. üíê ùì´ ‚òÄÔ∏è ÔøΩ",
    "It sounds like you are feeling really frustrated and upset by the way other people have been talking to you. üò† This is a very common problem that many of us deal with at some point in our lives. In addition to trying not to let it get under your skin as much (which can be difficult), there may be several things you could do about this situation right now.Firstly, it might help to talk to someone who cares about you about how these interactions make you feel. They might be able to offer suggestions for ways they think you could handle them better or even just being present when others try to bring you down.Secondarily, consider setting boundaries with those around you regarding what types of conversations you will tolerate from them. While it's important to be respectful of their feelings, you also deserve to be treated well too. If someone continues to harass you after you tell him/her 'no,' then he/she isn't worth having a relationship with anyway. Finally, please don't forget to take care of yourself during times when you need extra support emotionally because life can sometimes become overwhelming.I hope you find something helpful here. Good luck! ÔøΩÔøΩ",
    "üôÉ This can be very difficult to deal with, and I'm glad you reached out about it! You may want to consider a therapist who specializes in couples counseling so that they are aware of the fact that your girlfriend is doing this on her own (as an example), as well as how she feels when she does this. It would also help if there were some open discussions between both parties about what is going wrong, as well.If one partner has made up their mind that something did happen when actually nothing happened then there is no arguing with them because it becomes impossible to prove or disprove anything. So instead focus on what you feel was done right by each other and make sure those moments are remembered and celebrated too! Sometimes people need more support from others than just talking themselves through everything alone; sometimes we all just need someone else around us whom will listen without judgment while we talk ourselves through whatever situation is bothering us most at any particular time.This kind of thing happens every day among many different types of relationships across our country - whether romantic partnerships, friendships, family members etc...The important part here though is finding ways not only cope but grow together after these",
    "This sounds very difficult, but it's important to remember that you are not alone in this situation. People frequently blame others without thinking about the consequences or whether they have evidence to support their claims. It can be hard when someone is always accusing you and never believing your side of a story. üíî Consider talking with them about how you feel and see if there may be a way you both could work through these issues together. You also mentioned that people often say hurtful words to each other which makes me wonder what kind of relationships you have with those around you? Relationships should bring joy and happiness into our lives; however, sometimes we forget that our partners aren't perfect either! If any relationship has been damaged by something said between two people then perhaps now would be an excellent time to rebuild trust before moving forward with anything else (like having children). Sometimes people say mean comments out of jealousy or anger because they themselves don't believe anyone loves them anymore than whoever says nasty things towards another person does love him/herself less than that person. So maybe instead of focusing on yourself as much try reaching out more toward others so you won't need additional validation from them in"
